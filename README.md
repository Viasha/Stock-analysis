# Stock-analysis
# Overview of Project
## The Purpose
  The purpose of this project is to become familiar with refactoring coding in Microsoft VBA.
 This skill will become useful when working with large datasets because it allows the codes to run more effecient.
 The code is able to run more effecient because it uses less memory and takes fewer steps.
 During this project I was able to use refactored coding to analyze stock information from 2017 and 2018.
 
# Results
## VBA
Using the given "starter code", I was able to refactor my original code to a more logical and effecient code.
I used new variables to condense the data to gather information about total daily volume and return of stock based on the ticker.
Using the ticker array I created in my first code, I was able to use those ideas to analyze the returns of each stock.
I will include the refactored code I used.

# Summary
## Pros and Cons
  Refactoring code can be very beneficial in the real world. A major benefit is fresher, easier to understand code.
  Having clean code can make or break a design for a developer. It makes it easier to read and more logical.
  Cleaning the data will not make it any more or less functional so some developers opt out of refactoring because of the potential cons.
  It is possible for refactored coding to become corrupted and infect your device with bugs without being caught.
  It is also more time consuming to refactor codes. If you are on a time crutch refactoring your data may not be an option.
 ## Refactoring Stock Analysis
  In the instance of this challenge it was very beneficial to refactor this code to analyse the stock market.
  The refactored code could run the macro in little to no time. 
  When dealing with the stock market you need an analysis as soon as possible if the market is very volatile.
